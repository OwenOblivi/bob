            <strong>Welcome to the server. This MOTD will give you a quick overview of the things you should know. It can also be found directly on our forum.</strong>
            <br>
 
            <p><b>Rules</b>
                <br>
                <strong>Most of the rules are the same as you'd find in any other server, but with a few exceptions. For example, the fact that there is no New Life Rule (NLR) to respect on this server.</strong></p>
 
            <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
                <li>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prop/Building Rules</span>
                        <br> — No prop blocking/pushing/climbing, the only thing that's allowed is prop surfing as long as you aren't a combat class i.e. Zombie Hunter, Cop, Crim, Zombie, Alien.
                        <br> — Skybases aren't allowed. Don't build in the sky or any other area that is unreachable without propclimbing or surfing. If you make a base, the floor has to be the actual map itself.
</p>
                    <p>— You can't put a door, even with a keypad, on a public access area. This includes the PD and other places everybody goes through. You need to own the actual door to that place, before putting a fading door somewhere.
(AKA no putting fading doors in an alleyway, or otherwise passage that needs to be accessible at all times, or in someone else's place)</p>
<br>
<p>
— Fading doors obligatory. 
<br>
— Keep the fading door away from regular doors, they're buggy and can get stuck on the fading door. 
<br>
— Every map entrance has to be accessible using fading door rules. Blocking off one entrance and saying "It's not propblock because there's another entrance" is NOT a valid excuse.</p>
<br>
<p>
— The "One fading door per room" rule implies that as long as it isn't separated by a physical map door, it is still the same room, and so you can't be more than 1 fading door in that entire area. </p>
<br>
<p> — Unpunchable prop bases aren't allowed: It should always be possible to break into your base using badass fists. If you make clear punchable doors but make the rest of the walls unpunchable, this is allowed only as long as it's not made with the intent of dragging how long it takes to break in (no maze bases, bases that take a long time to get through, or bases that are just overly complicated) or making your base have kill boxes, where it's impossible to raid without getting shot at. </p>
<br>
<p> — Fading doors and entrances general have to be accessible at all times from a safe place, as in you shouldn't be able to kill someone who's lockpicking your door from inside your base. </p>
<br>
<p> — If you want to build somewhere, you have to make it accessible at all times with a fading door, and a keypad or a button. No blackout bases (All black bases or parts of a base where you can't see much), crouch/jump barriers, One-way props or just impossible to reach bases. You are not allowed to build in areas you do not own, unless it doesn't block the way. No building in the PD as a terrorist. And no BLOCKING in the PD as a cop, even with a keypad. Cops are only allowed to build minor barricades that you can jump over. Except for the Mayor's office and the sniper tower room, or other dead-end rooms that don't lead anywhere. Same for criminals with their own spawn area.
</p>
<br>
<p> — Really fucking far keypads are NOT allowed. Only ONE keypad must be placed next to the fading door (no fake keypad shit) and it must be within direct eyesight of the fading door. In short, if you're in front of the door, You should be able to see the keypad and be able to use it, while standing next to the door. The fading door must also be a toggle and not time-based. And you must not use your keyboard to close it when someone is cracking it. </p>
<br>
<p> — Only ONE fading door with a keypad per room in any given building. As in, no putting 3-4 fading doors in a row just to make it take forever to reach inside your place. Only one fading door per room, or per doorway. As in, one for the front door, then maybe one for your storage room or something, but that's it.
</p>
<br>
<p> — Every single base has to be raidable (including breakable with badass fists) Do not abuse the Badass Fists! This means if you're a Titan, Sweeper, or Berserker, you should only ever use the fists for combat-related purposes. Breaking into an actual enemy base (not just because it belongs to a guy you don't like.)</p>
                </li>
 
                <li>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Death Match Rules </span>
                        <br> — RDM is allowed as long as you're a combat class and you aren't RDMing your own team or Neutrals.
                        <br> — FFA (Free For All) Maps allow ALL RDM. 
                        <br> — Some events have RDM protection.
                    </p>
                    <p>— No rogues allowed. Undercover cops, false cops, or criminals, whatever you call it, don't do that. You must respect the alliance of the job you take. </p>
                    <p>— There is no New Life Rule on this server. This means that people do not pretend to forget they got killed. If the player remembers it, he remembers it, and that's that. </p>
<p> — If you want to kill someone, be aware that they'll most likely be pissed at you and try to kill you back. So don't complain about it if you failed to hide or protect yourself if they manage to succeed. </p>
                </li>
 
                <li>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Spawn Rules </span>
                        <br>
                        — No spawn camping, blocking, etc.
                        
                        <br> — If you see a player spawn somewhere, please understand that this is a public area and therefore cannot be part of your own personal base. </p>

<p> — You cannot hold players where they spawn, or otherwise block them or camp them. </p>
                </li>
 
                <li>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Raiding Rules </span>
                        <br>
                        </p><p>— Criminals can raid and steal from vendors and other peaceful jobs, but not kill them. Criminals may kill guards actively protecting neutrals while raiding. </p>
                        <p>— If you're a criminal you can raid vendors for their supplies. However you may not kill them. If they hire a guard to protect their stash, you may kill the guard(s), but the guard(s) may also kill you. </p>
                        <p>— Criminals can't steal from fellow criminals, which also means you can't refine while being a criminal. </p>
                        <p>— Criminals can only raid once every ten minutes.
</p>
                        <p>— Criminals can't break or blow up stuff just for the hell of it or if they can't take the loot out with them for whatever reason.  </p>
                        <p>— Vendors can't destroy their own supplies to keep criminals from stealing them.
</p>
                        <p>— Those who get raided can raid back in order to get their stuff back, provided their name is on the thing they're trying to earn back. (Disconnected doesn't count, it's free game) The 10 minutes timer also applies to counter-raids as well.</p>

<p>
— You CAN go Guard or Titan to protect your stuff.</p>
                </li>
 
                <li>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> General Rules </span>
                        <br> — Stay away from the top of the map if you're at a place where you can see through the floor, you shouldn't be there and should move. </p>
<br>
<p> — No mic spamming (Or any general spam for that matter)
If you are under 13, it'd be greatly appreciated if you double-checked your microphone volume to make sure it's not too loud. You might not have hit puberty yet, but that doesn't mean everyone else should suffer from it.
The only exception as far as music goes is if you want to pick a corner and play some music for people. If you do this you must stay in one spot, you may not go a combat class and play music while running around shooting people. </p>
<br>
<p>
— Don't disrespect other players in any way. (Verbally, Destroying their property, etc.)
This includes spamming/raging in all chat. (which is also against the rules)
Staff most of all. They are here to keep the server in check and help. If you have any trouble with one of our staff, please make a complaint on the forums with valid proof/evidence i.e. Screenshots/video. Don't count on witnesses for proof.
</p>
<br>
<p> — Don't be an ass or minge.
Seriously, come on now.
(That includes spamming bugbait, climb swep punching and teamstacking) </p>
<br>
<p> — Any type of hacks/scripts/bots are never allowed. </p>
<br>
<p> — If you are caught cheating in any shape or form you will be permanently banned without warning or appeal. Reasonable suspicion may be applied as well, so don't try to weasel your way out of it by using the "You don't have any proof" argument. If the majority of the staff present at the time believe you are cheating or hacking, you will be judged as such. However, if you really are just good enough to be considered hacking and were banned, make an appeal in the complaint section of the forums.
 </p>
<br>
<p> — Don't make scam trades in the gem market.
No tricking people into buying your offer that makes you get way more than it's worth.
Profit is fine but never something like; $1 offered for the price of $100k.
</p>
<br>
<p> — Last but not least, Have fun! </p>
